This project was created with create-react-app. It contains a variety of functions and their related tests. I use Jest for testing because it is built into create react-app. The functions in functions.js come from a tutorial from programmingwithmosh.com. The functions in codewars are solutions to codewars katas that I have created and tested on my own. My goal is to develop good habits by writing good tests for every function that I create.
